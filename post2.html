                        <p>This week on the #KenyaWomenSeries, we feature a Political  Scientist and Journalist with 16 years of experience; 13 of which have been in  the newsroom. She describes herself as a village girl who by God&rsquo;s grace  continues to survive the odds that life throws at her, by utilizing  opportunities and taking risks while ensuring that her life is meaningful and  positively contributes to societal well-being.<br />
                            She is fearless; once she was summoned to Parliament after  she and a colleague wrote investigative stories exposing corruption among  members of Parliament. Today, she is the Press Freedom, Safety and Advocacy  Manager at the Media Council of Kenya.<br />
                            Ladies and Gentlemen, a round of applause for Dinnah Ondari.<br />
                            Dinnah Ondari&rsquo;s&nbsp;career in journalism began in 2004  after graduating with a Diploma in Journalism and Mass Communication. &ldquo;One year  later, I got an internship opportunity at the People Daily Newspaper. Those  early days of my career were the most challenging, partly because I had zero  networks in the media industry. In addition, my knowledge of the city was  non-existent. I recall having a hard time tracing the building where I was to  report for my internship. Finally, I made my way there.<br />
                            After six months of the internship, they absorbed me as a  correspondent. But even the change of position did not make things any better  for me. As a correspondent, salaries never came on time; however, our employer  always ensured we had Ksh. 700 at the end of every week for transport to  work.&nbsp;<br />
                            Despite these financial problems, the newsroom I worked for  had a vibrant environment for the development of talent. Emerging from an  astute reputation as a bold weekly that delivered earth-shattering stories in  the 90&rsquo;s, the People Daily newspaper attracted some of the best brains in  journalism whose mentorship I benefitted from as a young journalist.<br />
                            Most of the senior and acclaimed journalists began their  careers at this point. Out of interest to report on issues of governance, I was  assigned to join the parliamentary team in 2006. This is when I made the  connection between politics and life. Having interacted with legislative  reporting, observed political processes and the role of media in setting the  agenda on issues of governance, I felt challenged to further my education to  enable me to make sense of life around me. I graduated from the University of  Nairobi (UoN) in December 2009 with a double major in Journalism and Political  Science.<br />
                            My thirst for education took me back to UoN in 2010 to  pursue Masters in Political Science and Public Administration. By this time,  the financial fortunes of my employer had improved, and I had also grown  through the ranks to become a Deputy News Editor. I had had a stint on TV where  I did news analysis, and I led the newspapers, parliamentary team.<br />
                          After more than a decade in the newsroom and having  graduated with my Master&rsquo;s degree in 2016, I started introspecting on the  future of my career. My heart yearned for more. Even though I had previously  attempted to leave the newsroom unsuccessfully, this time round the urge was  overwhelming. In 2018, in my incessant search for a new job, a friend shared a  job advertisement. I applied and as they say, the rest is history.&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>My current job has offered the challenges I had anticipated,  and more, which means that the levels of satisfaction have been surpassed.  Challenges push you to think, utilize your brain and explore new territories in  search of solutions. My knowledge and experience in political science and  journalism make it easier for me to contribute to the Media Council&rsquo;s  interventions in articulating policy issues and the work of media, identify and  respond to gaps, and do advocacy on the same.</p>
                          <p>Having faced the challenges as a journalist myself, I  respond to issues of safety of journalists and press freedom violations not  only as a matter of duty but from my heart.&rdquo;</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>1. Tell us some of your biggest accomplishments/ proud  moments and the events that have shaped your career journey.</p>
                          <p>One of my proud moments in my career, which was also the  riskiest, was when together with my colleague at People Daily, Anthony Mwangi,  we published investigative stories about corruption among members of parliament  (MPs). This earned us summons by the Speaker of the National Assembly, on the  floor of the House. We were expected to appear before the powers and privileges  committee to testify about our stories and name our sources.</p>
                          <p>With pressure from individual MPs and now summons staring at  us, Nairobi became very small for us. But thanks to efforts by the Group  Managing Editor who stood by our stories and the Media Council of Kenya who  marshalled the industry to rally behind us, the summons were not executed.  Looking back, I think fate was preparing me for the work I now do at the Media  Council.</p>
                          <p>I later served as the Secretary-General of the Kenya  Parliamentary Journalists Association (KPJA). My belief is that leadership is  an opportunity to serve. Therefore, my stint at KPJA marked a new dawn for the  Association as more women had started expressing interest in leading the  association which articulates the interests of parliamentary journalists as far  as the relationship between parliament and media is concerned.</p>
                          <p>My deputy was also a lady and I am glad this trend has  continued. The KPJA office was able to expand freedom of expression within the  association as well as spearhead cooperation and respect between parliament and  members, which is critical in creating a conducive working environment for  journalists working in parliament.</p>
                          <p>2. Given an opportunity to advise young women who want to  establish themselves as journalists, what would you tell them?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Like politics, journalism is not a walk in the park and  especially for women journalists. There will be challenges that threaten to  overwhelm you, such as wrong assumptions and generalizations/stereotypes and  sexual harassment. But all these can be overcome with the right skills,  passion, determination, positive attitude, integrity and prayer.</p>
                          <p>Often, opportunities come dressed in gowns that look like  work, do not doubt your ability to cope. Most of the challenges you face come  from people who are scared of your mere potential.</p>
